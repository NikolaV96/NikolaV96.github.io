                            but also how they were made. This is the one of the reasons why I started
                            IT & Computer Science in the first place. I set myself the task where I would acquire
                            the necessary knowledge to create my own innovative technologies. I am also a big 
                            advocate of self-improvement and learning is my passion.</p>

                                by 4 team members which had their own responsibilities towards the game development. My input for it was making the designs 
                                for the level and art style. Due to a small schedule of 3 months we were able to implement only the core gameplay of the game.

                            <p>This was the first ever web-based game that I have created. Cell defender is a 2D game which was
                                made with the help of Phaser 3 game engine. The inspiration of this game came from space invaders, but instead of 
                                shooting and dodging bullets, the aim is to use the platform to bounce back the bullets back at the attackers.

                        <p><br><br> This was a solo development project in which I had to develop an educational game! The biggest 
                            challenge for this prototype was to create something that would make people want to play it and subconscious learn 
                            from it. The goal of the game is to learn to recognize the flags of the individual countries of all seven continents.

                    <p><br><br> Project parrot is a turn-based game with point and click mechanics. The project was brought to life 
                        by 4 team members which had their own responsibilities towards the game development. My input for it was making the designs 
                        for the level and art style. Due to a small schedule of 3 months we were able to implement only the core gameplay of the game.

                    <p><br><br> The Nathan Hill project is First Person Shooter. The game is all about paranormal investigations. 
                        On this project we were a four-man team, and each was given the opportunity to build a level for the game. We had to 
                        come with a level design which will tie up well with the narrative of the overall story.

                    <p><br><br> This was my honors project for university. I wanted to get out of my comfort zone and create 
                        something that I have never done. The goal was to prove that a machine learning algorithms can adapt to every environment 
                        without being explicitly programmed to do so.

                    <p><br><br> Shadow clash was the first ever game I made in Game Make. It is a 2D platformer, 
                        action-oriented game with a small narrative. This project was made with the use of game maker programming 
                        language and all of the animation and textures done by me as well.
